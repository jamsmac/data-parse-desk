npm run test:all

# 2. Type check
npm run type-check

# 3. Lint check
npm run lint

# 4. Build for production
npm run build

# 5. Validate secrets
./scripts/validate-secrets.sh
```

### Step 2: Database Migration

```bash
# 1. Backup production database
supabase db dump > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# 2. Apply migrations
supabase db push

# 3. Verify migrations
supabase db diff
```

### Step 3: Deploy Application

```bash
# Option A: Vercel

curl https://your-domain.com/health

# 2. Smoke tests
npm run test:e2e:smoke

# 3. Monitor logs
# Check Sentry dashboard for errors

# 4. Performance check
# Run Lighthouse CI
```

### Step 5: Monitoring

```bash
# 1. Check Sentry for errors
# Visit: https://sentry.io/organizations/your-org/
